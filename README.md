# Bendroid

Interact with Bender from your mobile device.

## Roadmap

  * Think about OAuth workflow for slack
  * Spinner or something while the request is in-flight
  * Keep track of URL history
  * Grab title of PR pages and display in history
  * Allow navigating back to PR from app
  * Show error message on request failure
  * Show ephemeral popup on success
  * Allow reporting failures somehow (Google Analytics, perhaps)
  * Investigate getting this into the app store for Workiva
